SpreeHideableTaxons
===================

This extension adds a `hidden` field to `Spree::Taxon` and hides taxons with `hidden == true` from the default menus. It also shows an additional "Hidden" checkbox in the admin panel.

This is a reimplementation of [the great work](https://github.com/markalinn/Spree-Hidden-Taxons) done by [@markalinn](https://github.com/markalinn) updated for Spree 3.1+

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:
  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_hideable_taxons', github: 'theam/spree_hideable_taxons', branch: 'X-Y-stable'
  ```
  (Replace `X-Y-stable` with the version of Spree you're using)

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree_hideable_taxons:install
  ```

4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## TODO

* Add tests for:
  * Check that the admin controller saves the `hidden` field
  * Check that a taxonomy is not shown when its root taxon is hidden
  * Check that a taxon is not shown when it's hidden
* Current implementation extends the `Spree::FrontendHelper` module, which is not the best for extensibility. I think that helper should be transformed in a partial in Spree so it can be extended via `Deface`.
* Check compatibility with Spree 3.2.0+

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_hideable_taxons/factories'
```
